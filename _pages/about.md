I am currently working toward a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Shandong University, China. My research interests focus on Security and Privacy for IoT Systems, Wireless Sensing, and Mobile Computing.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Professor Pengfei Hu](https://perfecthu.github.io/) from [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.sdu.edu.cn/), Shandong University. I was advised by [Professor Riccardo Spolaor](https://riki8686.github.io/) from [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.sdu.edu.cn/), Shandong University.
