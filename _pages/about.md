I am currently working toward a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Shandong University, China. My research interests focus on Security and Privacy for IoT Systems, Wireless Sensing, and Side-channels Analysis.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Professor Pengfei Hu](https://perfecthu.github.io/) from School of Computer Science, Shandong University. I was advised by [Professor Riccardo Spolaor](https://riki8686.github.io/) from School of Computer Science, Shandong University.

You can find my CV here: [Wenhao Li's Curriculum Vitae](https://wenh-li.github.io/cv/).
