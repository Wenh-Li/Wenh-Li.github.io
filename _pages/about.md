I am currently working toward Ph.D from the School of Computer Science, Shandong University, China. My research interests include Security and Privacy for IoT Systems, Wireless Sensing, and Mobile Computing.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Professor Pengfei Hu](https://perfecthu.github.io/) from the School of Computer Science, Shandong University.

You can find my CV here: [Wenhao Li's Curriculum Vitae](https://wenh-li.github.io/cv/).
